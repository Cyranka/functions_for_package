A warehouse for visitors,"February 3, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"I chose an executive suite to receive a more personal service. That was a useless decision.\nCheck-in was fast but absolutely standardized. I asked for an upgrade, because my Hilton card allowed it, and the answer was that since I was in the higher category suite, they could not do anything. Actually an upgrade can mean a better view, a position further away from noise, etc ...in the same category of room, but the woman that attended me did not even look at her computer...\nThe room was normal with a tiny bathroom, which seemed anchored in the 80\'s. Sleep was good.\nWhen checking out, I asked for a late check.out  ( 1pm!!, only one hour...) and the person that answered the phone said that it was impossible and that they never offer late check-out in suites. I was absolutely astonished. Again I asked if there was any exception considering my Hilton status, and again the answer NO, NO NO.\nI carried my luggage to the bellmen in 6th avenue, and they told me that I had to go the other end of the building to deposit it. Even though I was travelling with an 8 y.o. girl, none of them dared to ask if we needed help. Probably they were too busy talking about the Superbowl! Why care about customers when we are having such a good time!\nWhen I arrived to the left-luggage they ask me to pay for each bag I was carrying. I probably spend more than 100 nights per year in hotels and that\u00b4s the first time I am asked to pay to leave my luggage during 4 hours!!. Only when I complained to the front desk manager I received a voucher.\nSo my general impression is bad. The room is ok for the price you pay but service is non-existent. There is no empathy in ther relation with customer, and eveything is done following the Hilton Manual. As in many other hotels in th US, staff is kind to the customer only when they smell a good tip.\nAnd regarding the Hilton Honors card it\'s only good for the WIFI, because there is no difference in the cold, lack of empathy and distant relation that workers of Hilton Midtown establish with travellers.",2
Loved it!,"February 3, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"I had a great stay at the Hilton. Down in the lobby, at the little store, Guy Montgomery attended us and he was so sweet and personable. He made sure that we got all of our questions answered and even gave us some great recommendations of things to do. His radiant personality made our stay 10x more pleasant.",5
Hilton Property Manhattan,"February 3, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"Very conveniently located to subway. A short walk to Bloomies, 5th Avenue, and even Broadway. Only give concierge if you are a diamond level hilton member although many other hiltons give concierge benefits to gold members. If you stop at the hilton desk on the main floor and agree to see a preview of their time share offers, you can get a weekend package for about $200/night plus extra goodies like a free dinner or $50 Amex card. Preview is about 1 hour.If there for NY Now, the shuttle is 2 blocks away at the Sheraton. The restaurant next door is pretty good.",5
Great hotel ,"February 3, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"Great hotel with a great team, especially Mr. Virdell who made my day by being very helpful and nice! Will definitely come back here. Guests will always come for a hotel but come back for the service.\n\nSuggestion: diversify your room types, may be better for upmarket guests staying in the area.",5
"Great time, super relaxing, TERRIBLE mattress!!","February 2, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"Sadly the very old, extremely lumpy mattress is the story, on the 38th floor. Offered zero support. I was super upset. Never in my lifetime have I complained. And the head board was so old, coming apart, we. I was moved to the 36th floor, an inconvenience as could barely move at this stage, unearthed an old back wound, but so worth the move. Margaret in housekeeping is a treasure, sweetest person whilst I was laid up for a few days, ugh. Roy, John at check in always top class..36th floor room was super quiet, great views of 6th avenue, so peaceful. It had that new fresh clean feeling! Fridges a lot smaller, impossible to hold more than one to two waters! But apart from all that, my back got better and I truly had the most relaxing time. Everyone super nice and helpful. So close to Central Park, Rockefeller Ctr, St. Patrick\'s Cathedral ..",4
NOTHING \u201cHilton\u201d about this Mid-town ECONO-INN.,"February 5, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"HONORS members get the privilege of waiting on a longer line at checkin-out. The non-Honors registration line moves faster and has more attendants. No pleasantries, \u201cthank you for being a Hilton member\u201d or welcome package. I had to ask for the complementary bottles of water. They were delivered to the room. The Hotel CONTRACTOR operating employees pay little or no attention to the franchise agreement with the landowner \u2013 who I assume is still HILTON.\n\nParking is run by another CONTRACTOR, not the hotel. The attendant did a walk around the car and inspected it for damage and handed me a ticket. He did not welcome us to the hotel. He did not offer to get a bell man for the bags. He was not friendly.\n\nThe room had very industrial feeling, definitely not warm and relaxing. It had haze grey walls and ceilings, worn \u201cmodern-style\u201d built-ins with funky round white lights, one contemporary picture, and a curved plug strip with a light that illuminates the entire room under the night stand \u2013 which defeats the purpose of the curtains. The room still has the 1990s style brass card key locks on the doors.The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen in 35 years of traveling and NEVER at a \u201cHilton\u201d. I have been in RV\u2019s with larger bathrooms. See picture. Beds were average. No mini-coffee maker! I have stayed in several NYC hotels that do not offer a coffee maker in every room, but on request they will provide and some have the audacity to charge. The Hilton mid-town claims they do not have coffee makers in the hotel and will not provide one under any circumstance. So instead of relaxing in the morning with my wife and an eye-opener cup of coffee brewed in room, I got up, got dressed and walked across the street to Starbuck\u2019s and brought back two cups of coffee.  Alex Saavedra, the operating company manager, grudgingly allowed 10,000 points for my inconvenience.\n \nBag check is ALSO run by another CONTRACTOR, not the hotel, $5.00 per bag cash in advance! This is the only hotel where I have ever encountered this charge.\n\nThe restaurants/bar all seem to be run by other different CONTRACTORS.\n \nIn addition to the $40.96 in State Occupancy (two different charges), sales and Javitis Center fee and City taxes, NYC or Hilton added a $25.00 \u201cUrban destination charge\u201d to the bill. I recently stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square and the bill did not include this charge.\n\nThere is nothing relaxing or upscale about the HILTON mid-town. In fact, my observation, the only thing HILTON about this hotel is the sign. There are much better choices in NYC! I will never stay there again.",2
The concierge and front desk management are FANTASTIC!!!!,"February 1, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"The front desk management went above and beyond. I left my bag in a restaurant a few blocks away but, we had an early morning flight. We called the hotel and talked with Rosa at the front desk. Rosa (or someone on her staff) went to the restaurant, picked it up for me, and then mailed it back to me in Kentucky. I can not say enough about their kindness throughout this ordeal. In addition, all of the hotel staff that we encountered were very kind and courteous. We loved this hotel and the location! Next time we go back to NYC we will definitely be staying at this hotel.",5
Great remodel and one of the best hotel gyms in NY,"January 25, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"Stayed here many times in the past for conferences, but generally not a Hilton fan being a Platinum SPG (and Marriott now) traveler.  Not a huge fan of the midtown area in NY, but conferences put you in areas with the most rooms at times.  I was pleasantly surprised at the facelift in the rooms and most of all, the GYM was FANTASTIC.  HUGE gym, Peloton bikes lined up (who does that!), TONS of dumbells and in multiple areas of the gym.  I would stay here again just for the gym...well done Hilton Midtown.  \n\nPhotos show off the improvements. \n\nRooms were top notch, spacious, had a large couch in it (and I don\'t have any status), HUGE HD TV with fast response time (not the typical slow wait 5 mins for the channel to change sitaution), large bathrooms with the cool backlight mirrors that had a magnified mirror and fogless area of the mirror as well (perfect for shaving after a hot shower), large fridge not packed with useless room service stuff), ample lighting, etc.  GREAT ROOM.\n\nGreat diner down the street on 55th and 6th - ASTRO DINER.  Go there for awesome fast true diner food.",4
&quot;herb and kitchen&quot;,"January 21, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"The hotel\'s grab and go food service offers an extensive range of different things to eat  BUT they charge $7.99 (USD) for a small sized bottle of water. Unfortunately, since they don\'t display the prices, my mother was shocked when she went to purchase one. After insulting their food and questioning whether it was cooked properly, she then understandably complained about the water being overly expensive refused to buy it...only purchasing a small bottle of milk. MUCH to my immediate disappointment, the man at the counter SNATCHED the money out of her hand. It was late at night but this dude could try to contain his anger a little longer. This THEN lead me to believe that the Hilton actually underpays its staff but idk anyways the rooms were nice other than the fact that my family members were too tall for the shower. \n\nBeautiful.",5
"Good location, clean, $25 destination charge/night","February 1, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"Stayed for four nights at this hotel during the LegalWeek conference.  The hotel was very busy.  The conference seemed well serviced by the hotel.  The food and beverage service was just fine.  The rooms do not have a coffee maker  which is disappointing.  A $25 destination charge was added per night with wifi, $15 lounge credit and $10 bistro credit.  So really the nightly charge is a forced spend in the hotel.    There is good breakfast buffet if you have a bed and breakfast package.  Otherwise it is very expensive. There is no restaurant service after breakfast and limited room service.  For a huge hotel the lack of these amenities seems odd. The room was clean and comfortable. ",3
Great experience with Sharon at the Executive Lounge,"February 1, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,My stay at this Hilton Midtown New York was great one. Thanks to Sharon in the Executive Lounge for the friendly and excellent service. Good location and easily accessible to midtown and great restaurants.,5
"Resting on their history, such a bad hotel","February 1, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"No room service\nNo spa\nNo restaurant \nNo mini bar\nHORRIBLE lumpy pillows\nRoom bedding smelt really dirty and gross\n7$ waters (more than the airport) if you can stand to wait in the 30 minute line to buy water...\nTv didn\'t work \nbath tube was peeling and brown\nSome of the staff were nice, most looked exhausted and unhappy \n\nDO NOT STAY HERE! Felt like a motel six. I left a day early. \n\nI will never come back to LegalTech as long as the continue to choose this venue. It was my first time at both the conference and the hotel. NEVER AGAIN.",1
Executive Lounge,"February 1, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,Sharon was very welcoming and friendly whilst we were at The Hilton Midtown for our business trip. Thank you for looking after us! I would definitely recommend this for a business trip - great location!,5
"Room OK, breakfast OK, but that\'s about it\u2026","January 21, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"Yes I know it\'s Manhattan and I know that means $$$$$ for not very much, so I guess I shouldn\'t be surprised that this Hilton perpetuates the gouging. \n\nOn a positive note the bedroom was big enough and clean and the bathroom was clean. \n\nI checked in as an HHonors Gold card member which apparently got me a room upgrade. It should have also given me free water and and free wifi, but at this Hilton \'free\' water and free premium wifi means you get to pay a mandatory $25 a day for the misnamed \'urban\' package. It did get me a free continental breakfast, complete with hovering waiters checking I didn\'t take anything hot from the buffet (an extra $18). It didn\'t get me lounge access (that\'s another $45 a day, I didn\'t bother).\n\nBottom line, it\'s a big impersonal hotel, and from the minute you walk through the door it feels like someone\'s trying to put their hand in your pocket to relieve you of more $$$$. This extends to left luggage which is charged at $5 per item per day, payable in cash only.",2
Always a good choice,"February 1, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"I stay at this hotel often for work. It\u2019s a great location and a good experience. I do wish that there was a full-fledged restaurant and room service, however. It\u2019s surprising not to find that at a Hilton. This particular visit was good overall. But when I first checked in the woman at the front desk ignored me and helped a man who was not in the Hilton Honors line instead. We were the only 2 people in line so it wasn\u2019t busy and seemed intentional on her part, and since I arrived in line first and was in the Hilton Honors line, I should have been helped first. Other than that it was a great stay, and Sharon, the manager at the Executive Lounge was great. She always remembered me and was always welcoming. ",4
Thanks for a great service ,"January 31, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,Had a great time at Hilton Midtown this week. \nSpecial thanks to Nati and Eliseo from the front office for the great service. \nIt would be great to come and visit you again next time I am at New York City. ,5
Little Things that drive me crazy,"January 31, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,I am in NYC frequently for business and the Midtown is my first choice dependent on rates. I just completed a 7 night business stay and a few things that bothered me again with this hotel.\n1-Every time I am there they always have elevator issues causing huge log jams in the lobby.\n2- I always due electronic pre check in and have them pick my room this time I was given a HC bathroom with way too many bars and devices. They was have an abundance of these and pawn them off on guests who use electronic check in? Plus there was rust all over the bathroom wall from where the bars were hung.\n3- I was given a card upon check in and told I would get a 10 dollar daily credit used it at the Herb Kitchen and the charges still hit my room.\n4- Digital Key went down on day 3 and had to hike back down to the main lobby to get a room key after making may way up to floor 20.\n\nThese are not major but little annoying things add up....,3
Lovely Stay,"January 30, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"I brought my daughter to NYC this weekend for her Sweet 16 and had an amazing stay at the Hilton Midtown. The breakfast buffet was a great start to the day and Chef Guy Montgomery made my daughter a beautiful and delicious chocolate dessert plate decorated with strawberries and other decorative chocolates. The hotel room was clean, large, comfy and there was no shortage of activity for adults at the hotel lounge/bar. Highly Recommended!",5
Amazing stay,"January 30, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"Wow. I stayed a few weeks ago had a great view, hotel staff were amazing and couldn\u2019t be anymore helpful, I think truthfully it\u2019s the best hotel I\u2019ve been to would stay here again if ever I get the chance to go to New York for a second time.",5
Small meeting executed with precision,"January 30, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"Great team at the Hilton NY midtown, we had one small meeting and one large meeting operating at different times this year. The friendly staff, from the top down made my experience effortless, seamless and all our attendees were happy! The food was delicious and plentiful and each member of the team welcomed us with a smile immediately followed by a thank you. Great location for corporate meetings too! Thank you Team Hilton!!",5
Great Hilton diamond club experience,"January 30, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"Had a great experience and a great host, Sharon. Good meeting location! Highly recommend for anyone traveling and looking for a good area to meet, discuss, and have coffee. Good place for a break from the crowds.",4
Great experience!,"January 30, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,Was recently in town for legal week at the Hilton.   Everyone was fantastic but Sharon went above and beyond to make our stay that much better.   Thanks and will be back very soon!!!!!!  Great stay overall.,5

New York Hilton Midtown is a Classic,"January 30, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"I don\u2019t know for how many years I stay in New York Hilton Midtown when I come to town.\nAnd I always am pleased and very satisfied.\nIt is like a feel at home.\nIt can\u2019t be better located, next to everything that really matters.\nYesterday, for instance I went (and came back) on foot to theater.\nIt is a great choice in NY.",5
$300 a night for peeling wallpaper and no coffee maker,"January 29, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"We all know NYC hotel rooms command top dollar. I know I probably paid more by booking through a conference website, but jeez... the \u201cspecial\u201d to upgrade for an additional fee at checkin was insulting. The WiFi is not so hot and the TV software isn\u2019t working tonight, so I\u2019m trapped watching pay per view previews. And no coffee maker in room - don\u2019t get me started!",3
Sharon is Amazing ,"January 29, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,The Hilton New York has always been a favorite hotel for me. I am especially thrilled to visit the executive lounge. Sharon at the executive lounge always make sure I am well taken care of. Highly recommend a visit to the executive lounge if you stay at the Hilton New York. ,5
Excellent Service,"January 29, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"Hotel is great location for business (or leisure) in Midtown.   Diamond HHonors members have use of the Executive Lounge located just off the main lobby.  Mornings in the Executive Lounge are hosted by Sharon, who is very friendly and welcoming.  An ideal hotel made even better by warm friendly staff such as Sharon.",5
"Great view of Central Park, but that\'s it...","January 28, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"No real appreciation for customers...they figure you need a place to stay and that\'s what you get. As a Hilton Honors member, no one went above or beyond during my stay to get me my basic benefits. No water, no coffee, no internet in my room for hours...the fire alarm going off at 5:00 AM. Lines to check-in, lines to check-out...even for HH. To top it off, the attitude of the front desk staff was worse than the DMV...",2
AMAZING Staff!,"January 27, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"I love this hotel and even more so the staffl. I\'ve stayed here since October, 2001 and it holds a special place for me.  the staff at the front desk, especially Anika, is great and goes above and beyond in all she does - my daughter still talks about her.  The Executive Lounge staff is second to none, especially Mercedes, Eduardo, Sharon, David, Jose, Guierllmo, Kim, Sharon and Gabriella - some also work at the front desk now.  This is a home away from home for me and I am forever grateful!!!",5
attention to detail,"January 27, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"Ralph, our server at the lunge was amazing! Made us feel welcome and helped us celebrate our engagement ! Then the checf came out to check on our dinner, what a wonderful treat. \nEvery should take a lesson from their friendleness an attention to detail.",5
Chef Guy Montgomery,"January 26, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,We really enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Midtown but especially the service we received at the Herb n Kitchen. Chef Guy had a wonderful personality and his food offerings are delicious. We enjoyed the Pizza and the Prime Rib Chili!!   Thanks Guy for making our stay more special.,5
THE BEST THERE IS!,"January 26, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"This was an excellent RCI exchange!  Not only is the facility extremely nice; the location is even better.  We parked our car in valet parking and could walk everywhere we wanted to go.  This included seeing &quot;Chicago&quot;, with Cuba Gooding, Jr., dining in some very nice restaurants, visited lots of shops, Fox, Rockefeller Center, etc.  The room  was cleaned daily, bottled water was delivered daily, and everyone was very hospitable.  We have owned our Timeshare for 35 years, and this is the best we have seen for an exchange.",5
So incredibly disappointing for a Hilton,"January 25, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"This place is so incredibly disappointing for a Hilton.   The rooms are nice, the staff are decent, the location is great.   That\'s the easiest summary.  \n\nThe biggest and most severe drawback is a room that won\'t cool down.  My room held solid at 75 degrees in the middle/end of January.  Windows open, fan on, then fan off...it wouldn\'t cool down.   After calling Engineering at 7am (mind you, I\'ve barely slept because it was 75 degrees), they bring a box fan to my room and tell me to turn off the in-room climate control.   The fan was a God send...but...shocking given that this is a Hilton, in the middle of NYC in the dead of winter.   WHY?!   \n\nOverall, I\'d say there are much better options to stay at in NY...especially for the price.",2
No Longer Using Due to Urban Resort Fee,"January 24, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"I have been a regular at this hotel but have now switched to other midtown hotels due to a hidden charge called an urban resort fee that Hilton Midtown have introduced.  While credits are given for use of the bar, gift shop and cafe to offset the fee - I didn\u2019t use these so it was an unreasonable charge.\n\nI estimate I have paid over $3,000 for other hotels I am now using instead of the Hilton Midtown (including other NY Hilton hotels which are great) I\u2019d much prefer they just disclose their honest hotel rate upfront and avoid the hidden fees.  In a new world of Airbnb and transparent pricing, Hilton Midtown have got this one badly wrong.",1
Great Location!,"January 24, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"We had 3 Suites over two floors. This was a celebratory trip to mark a special time.\nMy sons visited last year and raved about the place. Only thing to do was to return with all the family in tow.\n\nOur suite was a nice size, appeared clean, coffee table in lounge had not been cleaned/ wiped in the 3 days we were there, bathroom small, plumbing not great, in need of maintenance and updating. Not the cleanest bath.\nBed was super comfy as were the pillows.\nShame the suite had no tea or coffee facilities yet it had a fridge.\n\nBreakfast was included and this deserves a mention of its own.\nFor a continental breakfast you can\'t go wrong. Lots on offer, cereal, porridge, fresh fruit, yoghurt, boiled eggs, bagels, toast, jam, peanut butter. Fresh orange juice, teas and coffee. The staff in the Executive Suite are helpful and courteous.\nI really enjoyed  my breakfast experience. Only negative, the boiled eggs were fridge cold. Couldn\'t tell when they were cooked and each one was black as in over cooked.\nStill, nothing to complain about.\n\nNew York is an expensive place, however, the herb kitchen was extortionate. We expect over the top prices not to have the p taken.\nWe had a baby (21 months) on soya milk. Ridiculous prices for a small bottle to feed him. \nBar prices it as expected, just had two glasses of wine over two nights. Not the best wine even though you\'re charged top dollar.\n\nWe found this hotel was the perfect location for us. We were there to enjoy our trip not move in. \nWe had a great time due to being all together, not because of the hotel. \n\nOur breakfast staff stood out as delivering a great service, child friendly, treated us well. Can\'t fault them. \nPay extra for the upgrade or breakfast you won\'t be disappointed.\nReception big and anonymous. By design not default.\n\nI would recommend this hotel to everyone. The minor faults can be fixed. The experience is what you make it. Ours was great.",4
Just ok ...,"January 24, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"We stayed at the Hilton Midtown for four nights between New Year\'s Eve and Jan 4, 2019.  The room was okay; relatively clean however, bathtub could have been cleaner and I washed it myself so that I knew it was clean.  The bed was horribly uncomfortable the sheets felt like an SOS pad.  The location was great. Customer service at check in / check out experience was just ok.",4
Below Expectations for Hilton in NYC,"January 21, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"From extended wait times checking in and getting our rooms available after a 30hour flight to below standard in room amenities this is not a stay I would wish to repeat.\n\nWe had two adjoining rooms booked for our family of 5 and when we got to the rooms there was only two double beds and three towels. It took three trips to the front desk to get the 5th bed made which was done not done until 9:30pm, which is not acceptable after a 30 hour flight! Still did not manage to get the towels resolved over the two nights stay.\n\nIt was also very poor that the rooms did not have any basic tea and coffee making facilities.\n\nOnly positive was the complimentary lounge access during the extended wait for our rooms and the general location of the hotel.\n\nOn leaving NYC we were forced to spend an additional night in the USA and we chose the Marriot. Such a better experience all around. This may have been my last stay at a Hilton",2
What was there to like ,"January 20, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"There is absolutely no service other than they make the bed and give clean towels. Honestly it was awful. The mandatory charges after paying a fortune was ridiculous. Nothing to make tea or coffee with not a kettle, cup or spoon. Hotel is central to everything. Rooms are large, bathrooms small and old. Deffinately not a bit of luxuary. Just ordinary. Perhaps there is better. ",3
I loved everything about this hotel... except the daily mandatory pre-tax charges,"January 19, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"I loved everything about this hotel... except the $25 in daily mandatory pre-tax charges. As a Diamond member with access to the Executive Lounge, I didn\u2019t want or need to spend an additional $10 per day in Herb &amp; Kitchen and $15 per day in the bar. Herb &amp; Kitchen at least had a variety of grab-and-go items such as snacks, sandwiches, bakery items, etc. The bar, however, was overcrowded and understaffed with a very limited menu. If you are not a drinker, you basically pay $15 per day for nothing. We tried to order appetizers one evening, and it took over 30 minutes just to place the order. Of the limited offerings on the menu, only pretzels were available. When they finally arrived, they were barely edible, and they had run out of the dips which come with them. Two people were trying to serve and ring up the entire bar, and the place was a mess. It was really a shame, because it was such a contrast to the rest of the hotel. The midtown location can\u2019t be beat, and the rooms are updated, clean, and spacious by New York standards. The Executive Lounge on the ground floor is huge, with a nice variety of breakfast items. We also stopped in later in the day for coffee, hot chocolate, fruit, cookies, etc. Access is by room key, and we noticed lurkers outside the door sometimes waiting for the door to open so they could walk in. This needs to be better monitored. After checkout, we were disappointed that we had to pay $5 per bag to store them for a couple of hours before our flight. We will probably return, but hope the mandatory fees become a thing of the past.",4

US Open,"January 19, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"Great hotel and service. Parking was a nightmare and not explanined that I had to pay 50 dollars every time I took the vehicle out of the lot. Great location to travel to the US Open! Time Square is a quick hop, skip, and a jump away... all the food locations and shopping New York is known for are a quick walk down the street.",3
Such a wonderful experience!,"January 18, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,Hotel Hilton is centrally located in NY. Very vibrant and walking friendly. It has lots of wonderful amenities. Our favorite is Herb N\' Kitchen. Main chef is Guy Montgomery. He is really amazing!! Food he makes taste great and also he is super kind. He treated us with full buffet breakfast!! We wish there are more people like him! 10*,5
"Large and clean room, great location, anything else will cost extra","January 18, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"Stayed at this hotel for almost a week.\nThe location is good- very close to Central Park, close enough to the theatre district, and as always in New York- everything is within walk distance.\nThe king room was very big, the bed is comfortable (especially the pillows...), the room is clean though the cleaning service could have been a bit better but overall great room at a very nice hotel.\nAnything other than that would cost you extra- food, parking, gym, even storing luggage (costs 5$ per item), and if you\'re not an HHonors member- wifi too.",4
Perfect Midtown Location,"January 15, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"This hotel is located close to so many iconic NYC landmarks.  It\'s walking distance to Central Park, Times Square and Rockefeller Center to name a few.  There are a variety of subway stops close by when you want to get around town reasonably or you can always find a taxi in front of the hotel. If you like food trucks there is one of the best food trucks directly across the street from the hotel, Halal Brothes, there us always a line of people waiting for food, buts it\'s super reasonable and worth the wait. The hotel has an excellent staff  and rooms.  For an additional fee at check-in ($25 per person when we were there) they offer an Executive Lounge where you can go throughout the day for  different eats and drinks.....continental breakfast, cookies, fruit, appetizers, coffee, tea, juice and water.  It\'s well worth it for the convience if you are on a tight schedule or just want to avoid the lines at the hotel cafe.  I have stayed here multiple times when in NYC and I will stay here again.",5
Amazing Hotel in Best Location,"January 15, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"I loved my stay at this Hilton.  Very impressive lobby and helpful employees for every question I had!  My room was perfect.  I liked the stores within the lobby, especially the small store where I could purchase a few snacks rather than going out to find what I wanted!

Great Midtown Stay,"January 15, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"Wonderful service, beautiful space, excellent location, great casual food at hotel restaurant. We had a 2-night stay and would return again.  Only issue was price, but for the area in Manhattan it was comparable to other hotels.",5
"Nice, clean, friendly.","January 15, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"My daughter and I stayed at this Hilton last weekend. As part of her Christmas gift, we had tickets to BroadwayCon and Mean Girls.  The hotel is very nice, clean, and accommodating. There was a mini fridge in our room, but no coffee maker or microwave. Being on the 40th floor, coffee in the room would have been great. The coffee served at Herb n\u2019 Kitchen was delicious though. The gift shop and various restaurants in the lobby we more than enough to get whatever we needed. The room was more spacious than other hotel rooms in the Times Square area. The bathroom was clean and well lit.  The only complaint about the bathroom is that the only electrical outlet in there did not work, which made using the the hair dryer difficult.  We were supposed to have a \u201cskyline\u201d view, but didn\u2019t. Our only view was of the bhuoling across the street.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay.  I would like to note that at one point before our trip, I we thought we were going to have to change our plans due to a change in school schedules. I called the hotel about a month before our reservation to see if we could change it to a week earlier. We were told \u201cno changes, no cancelations.\u201d  For that reason, I probably would not book this hotel again.  I often schedule trips like this 6-9 months in advance and having plans change is always a possibility. Being able to change a reservation without losing $650 would be very impoertant. Luckily, this time we were able to travel on our original dates.",4
BroadwayCon,"January 15, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,We stayed at the NY Hilton Midtown because it was home to the BroadwayCon 2019 event. Easy access between guest rooms and the event space was perfect - hotel amenities and services were great. Location was clutch. Highly recommend.,4
Great Location,"January 15, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,"The Hilton Midtown is just that - midtown in New York City with a perfect location.  When you step out onto 6th Avenue you can head 5 blocks north and be in Central Park, or 6 blocks south and be in Times Square.  In between are great restaurants, Radio City Music Hall, Rockefeller Center, MOMA, St. Patrick\'s Cathedral, and more.  While a busy hotel, the rooms are quiet and provide a nice respite from the hustle and bustle of the city.  I would recommend this to my family and friends traveling to NYC.",5
Executive Lounge Staff,"January 15, 2019",a TripAdvisor user,I am incredibly thankful for many of the employees!! My husband and I have stayed at the Hilton Midtown for ten years and we have made amazing friendships with the staff! Each one of them deserves recognition for ALL they do.,5
